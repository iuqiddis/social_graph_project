    "[New York Social Diary](https://web.archive.org/web/20150913224145/http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/) is a kind-of  voyeuristic view into New York's socially well-to-do. The data forms a natural social graph for New York's social elite, and such is an interesting dataset to play with.  An example is the this page of a [run-of-the-mill holiday party](https://web.archive.org/web/20150913224145/http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/party-pictures/2014/holiday-dinners-and-doers). Please note that these links point to the internet archive, as the original website has recently removed most of its archives. Many of the images no longer load, but all the HTML is still there.\n",

    "For our purpose, notice that the photos have carefully annotated captions labeling those that appear in the photos.  We can think of this as implicitly implying a social graph: there is a connection between two individuals if they appear in a picture together.\n",

    "For this project, I'll assemble the social graph from photo captions for parties dated December 1, 2014, and before.  Using this graph, I'll make guesses at the most popular socialites, the most influential people, and the most tightly coupled pairs.\n",

    "1. Get a list of all the photo pages to be analyzed.\n",

    "Now that we have some sample captions, let's start parsing names out of those captions.  There are many ways of going about this, and we leave the details up to you.  Some issues to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Some captions are not useful: they contain long narrative texts that explain the event.  Try to find some heuristic rules to separate captions that are a list of names from those that are not.  A few heuristics include:\n",
    "    - look for sentences (which have verbs) and as opposed to lists of nouns. For example, [`nltk` does part of speech tagging](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html) but it is a little slow. There may also be heuristics that accomplish the same thing.\n",
    "    - Similarly, spaCy's [entity recognition](https://spacy.io/docs/usage/entity-recognition) could be useful here.\n",
    "    - Look for commonly repeated threads (e.g. you might end up picking up the photo credits or people such as \"a friend\").\n",
    "    - Long captions are often not lists of people.  The cutoff is subjective, but for grading purposes, *set that cutoff at 250 characters*.\n",
    "  2. You will want to separate the captions based on various forms of punctuation.  Try using `re.split`, which is more sophisticated than `string.split`. **Note**: The reference solution uses regex exclusively for name parsing.\n",
    "  3. You might find a person named \"ra Lebenthal\".  There is no one by this name.  Can anyone spot what's happening here?\n",
    "  4. This site is pretty formal and likes to say things like \"Mayor Michael Bloomberg\" after his election but \"Michael Bloomberg\" before his election.  Can you find other ('optional') titles that are being used?  They should probably be filtered out because they ultimately refer to the same person: \"Michael Bloomberg.\"\n",
    "  5. There is a special case you might find where couples are written as eg. \"John and Mary Smith\". You will need to write some extra logic to make sure this properly parses to two names: \"John Smith\" and \"Mary Smith\".\n",
    "  6. When parsing names from captions, it can help to look at your output frequently and address the problems that you see coming up, iterating until you have a list that looks reasonable. This is the approach used in the reference solution. Because we can only asymptotically approach perfect identification and entity matching, we have to stop somewhere.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Questions worth considering:**\n",
    "  1. Who is Patrick McMullan and should he be included in the results? How would you address this?\n",
    "  2. What else could you do to improve the quality of the graph's information?"
